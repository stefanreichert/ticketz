# TicketZ

## Prelude
A fullstack SpringBoot REST/SSR application that follows the ports & adapter (or hexagonal architecture) approach. It is just for the fun of it, because it was a while ago when I last coded Java/Spring.
I took a particular look at:
* REST Controllers & Validation
* SSR & Thymeleaf
* Spring Security
* Spring Data JPA
* Bootstrap

So... nothing special here, but still a good exercise for me :)

## How to run
Well... select the TicketZApplication class and run it. The SSR frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:8080/ticketz/index`, the REST API at `http://localhost:8080/ticketz/api/*`. You may use the following credentials to login: `test@us.er/test`.
